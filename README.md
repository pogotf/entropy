entropy is a hud for tf2. it's based on lighthud-m0re by hypnotize but with features that i wanted and a different color scheme because it looks cool.

things may be done in a very crude way. i don't really know what i'm doing in terms of editing huds but if it works, it works.

i'm not exactly sure if performance is impacted by most of these changes, but somehow the average fps seems to be better for this than lighthud

changelog:  
*3d models (turn off using cl_hud_playerclass_use_playermodel 0)  
main menu background (go mclaren)  
menu layout (got rid of a few buttons and moved them around)  
complete color overhaul (backpack, overheal, low hp/ammo)  

to-do:  
maybe the little win panel thing comes back  

*known performance impact
