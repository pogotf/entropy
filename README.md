entropy is a hud for tf2. it's based on lighthud-m0re by hypnotize but with features that i wanted and a different color scheme because it looks cool.

i'm not exactly sure if performance is impacted by most of these changes.

changelog:  
*3d models (turn off using cl_hud_playerclass_use_playermodel 0)  
main menu background (go mclaren)  
menu layout (got rid of a few buttons and moved them around)  
complete color overhaul (backpack, overheal, low hp/ammo)  

to-do:  
idk yet i'll figure it out when i get annoyed by something

*known performance impact
