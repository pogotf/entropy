entropy is my personal hud based on lighthud by hypnotize.

things may be done in a very crude way but if it works, it works.

changelog:  
*3d models (turn off using cl_hud_playerclass_use_playermodel 0)  
main menu background (go mclaren)  
menu layout (got rid of a few buttons and moved them around)  
complete color overhaul (backpack, overheal, low hp/ammo)  
fps increases including match hud fix  

to-do:  
maybe the little win panel thing comes back  

*known performance impact

fps seems to be slightly better than lighthud.
